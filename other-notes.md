# The Key is the marginal product of capital, and when it is higher and when it is 
lower

By world standards, India is a long way from being the poorest country. In 1960, Niger was richer than India on a per person basis. But in the following half century, Niger became poorer, not richer. GDP per person decreased by almost 30 percent

### Three questions - useful ones

- How does the capital stock increase?
- What are the factors that lead to output growth?
- What are the differences between growth in a closed economy and growth in an open economy?


    - What are the main possible explanations for real GDP differences across countries?
    - How important are differences in technology for explaining differences in real GDP 
		across countries?

														Labor Hours ---> Aggregate Production function -> Read GDP
														Human Capital-^
**The aggregate production function combines an economy’s physical capital stock, labor hours, human capital, and technology to produce output (real gross domestic product [real GDP]).**

**Physical capital** - the stock of factories and machinery in the economy.
**Human capital** - skills and education of the workforce.
**Technology** - everything else that effects output(not characterised by labor, physical or human capital).

**Technology** includes:
    Knowledge. The technological know-how of the economy
    Social infrastructure. The institutions and social structures that allow a country to 
		produce its real GDP
    Natural resources. The land and mineral resources in the country

**marginal product of capital** - the extra output obtained from one more unit of capital

- Why might we see either convergence or divergence? Part of the answer has to do with the marginal product of capital in the two countries. Suppose that Solovakia is richer because it has a larger stock of physical capital than Solovenia. In that case, we expect the marginal product of capital to be larger in Solovenia. Solovenia is a more competitive economy than Solovakia. Juan will want to invest at home, while Una will take some of the output that she produces in Solovakia and invest it in Solovenia. Therefore we expect capital to migrate from Solovakia to Solovenia. As a consequence, it is likely that Solovenia will grow faster than Solovakia, leading to convergence

- The production function tells us that if we know four things—the size of the workforce, the amount of physical capital, the amount of human capital, and the level of technology—then we know how much output we are producing. When comparing two countries, if we find that one country has more physical capital, more labor, a better educated and trained workforce (that is, more human capital), and superior technology, then we know that country will have more output.

**Technology Frontier**: where the most advanced production technologies are available.
*one can be on or inside the technology frontier*

**NonExcludable Good**: knowledge is an example, it is something which is impossible to 
selectively deny access to. This reduces the incentive to create more knownledge, 
hence patents and copyright. Knowledge is also **nonrival good**, its consumption does 
not hinder others' consumption.

    - Differences in real GDP across countries can come from differences in population, physical capital, human capital, and technology.

    - After controlling for differences in labor, physical capital, and human capital, a significant difference in real GDP across countries remains.
^^ this demonstrates the importance of technology and other infrastructure, such as 
courts to ensure the incentives to create.

**Capital goods**: such as trucks and factories which produce more goods without being 
completely used up in the process. One form of investment is in these capital goods 
which are accumulated.
**Depreciation rate**: is the rate at which these capital goods must be replaced.

		Capital stock growth rate = (investment / capital stock) - depreciation rate

~~~
If the three economies were identical except for their capital stocks and if there were no growth in human capital and technology, they would indeed converge to exactly the same level of capital stock and output
~~~

**Property rights**: 
Investors will need a higher rate of return in order to offset the risk of investing 
somewhere where the infrastructure is less adequate to ensure payment/reward.

**Balanced growth rate**
		balanced-growth output-per-worker growth rate=human capital growth 
		rate + (1 / 1 − a × technology growth rate).


    - Balanced growth occurs when capital stock grows at the same rate as output. Along a balanced-growth path, the ratio of output to capital stock does not change.
    - Balanced growth is important to understand because over long periods of time, we expect economies to reach their balanced-growth path.
    - There are reasons to expect at least some convergence in physical capital, human capital, and knowledge. However, there is no strong argument for why we would see convergence in social infrastructure.
