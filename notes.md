Explain how the economic growth of a developing nation may be different from that of a developed nation, and the challenges faced when attempting to increase its income per capita to the same level as that of developed nations.

# Notes for Essay 1 Econs Theory Summative.

    - Economic growth of a developing nation vs that of a developed nation 
    - What challenges does a developing nation face in trying to match 
      the income per capita of a developed nation?

Discussion of factors omitted from Solow, eg Human capital, also
political stability, and other fundamental causes of economic
performance.

## Plans
Begin by explaining and looking at the Solow growth model for a high level, broad overview of the 
question. Then move on to tackle the specific issues which inhibit the model from manifesting.

### Solow model 
Explains the convergence of economies to a steady state of growth per capita. 
This is driven by "Investment and depreciation".

Production function: 

Y(t) or Q = annual quantity of goods produced by K units of Capital and L units of Labour;
        Q = F( K(t), L(t) );

1. Assumes that first differential by each component is greater than zero (Q is increasing),
and the second differential is less than zero (decreasing in rate);
2. Also assumes that F has constant returns to scale (increase the factors by some proportion, 
F increasing by this proportion);

// Edit to 2. constant returns to scale can only occur when capital and labour vary, such 
as taking augmented labour through technology progress.

Rewritten in per worker (per capita), - let x = 1 / L:
        xQ = F(xK, xL)
        Q / L = F(K/L, 1)
        k = capital per worker = K / L 
        q = output per worker = Q / L
        q = some function of capital per worker = f(k)
        where f(k) = F(k, 1)
    The function should hold for the previous assumptions, for instance:
        f(k) = sqrt(k);
    rate of change in k = marginal production of capital 
    downward concavity = diminishing marginal returns

Solow's fundamental differential equation:
    RoC of capital stock = rate of investment - rate of depreciation
    =   dk/dt = sf(k) - dk

Rate of investment:
        i = sq = sf(k)
    where s is a constant representing the rate of savings, between 0 and 1;
Rate of Depreciation:
    annual depreciation = dk where d (omega) is the proportionality constant, 
    referred to as depreciation rate;

**
Solow’s economic growth model is a great example of how we can use
differential equations in real life.
The model can be modified to include various inputs including growth
in the labor force and technological improvements.
The key to short-run growth is increased investments, while
technology and efficiency improve long-run growth.

I should use this ^^ by plugging into formulas these other vars...

## Solow with respect to labour augmenting technology 
Capital accumulation cannot raise per capita income forever, therefore in order for 
sustained economic growth, some assumption needs to be abandoned. Therefore we will allow the 
function to change over time as technology progresses.

Therefore the function becomes: 
        Y = K^o(AL)^(1-o) where A is tech at that time...
    This represents the production variables in terms of PER UNIT OF EFFECTIVE LABOUR,
    rather than just per capita;
